### ðŸŒž Background: Challenges in Thin-Film Solar Cells
Thin-film solar cells based on **Aâ‚‚BCXâ‚„ (e.g., kesterite)** and **ABXâ‚‚ (e.g., chalcopyrite)** compounds have gained attention as **low-cost, earth-abundant alternatives** to silicon photovoltaics (PVs). However, their **efficiency remains below 15%**, significantly lower than **Si (>26%)** and **perovskites (>25%)**.

ðŸ”¬ **Challenges include:**
- **Defect-driven efficiency losses** due to deep-level defects.
- **Inefficient charge transport** caused by cation disorder.
- **Narrow chemical space exploration** limiting material breakthroughs.

ðŸ’¡ **AI-Powered Material Discovery**
- **Machine learning (ML)** models can efficiently screen vast chemical spaces to **predict stable, defect-tolerant materials**.
- This platform integrates **composition-based ML predictions** and **graph-based MLFF optimization** to **accelerate the discovery of novel semiconductors** for next-generation thin-film solar cells.
